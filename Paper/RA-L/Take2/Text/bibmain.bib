Two projects are presented: Tic-tac-toe Opponent Robot and Environmentalist Robot. The first project use competitive search techniques of the Artificial Intelligence, computational vision, electronic and pneumatic concepts for ability decision making for a robotic agent on the tic-tac-toe game. The second project consists of a game that contains a questions and answers database about environmental themes. An algorithm selects the group of questions to be answered by the player, analyses the answers and sends the result to a industrial robot through serial port. According with the player performance, the robot makes congratulation movements and giving a gift to the winner player. Otherwise, the robot makes movements, disapproving the player performance.}, booktitle={Proceedings of 2011 International Conference on Computer Science and Network Technology}, author={de Lemos, Marilza Antunes and Liberado, Eduardo Verri}, year={2011}, month={Dec}, pages={2843–2846} }

@article{bib13, title={Towards Rehabilitation of Mughal Era Historical Places using 7 DOF Robotic Manipulator}, DOI={10.1109/ICRAI47710.2019.8967360}, abstractNote={The results showed that the manipulator successfully tracked the given path to perform the desired operation in mihrab as well as calligraphy operation on spandrel to restore the lost inscriptions. The central aim of this research is to propose a solution to rehabilitate historic places using a robotic manipulator. In this pursuit, the objective is to clean flat or curved surfaces of mihrab/muqarnas and to write lost Arabic inscriptions on spandrel using 7 Degree of freedom (DOF) robotic manipulator. Inverse kinematics solution for 7 DOF is derived by fixing redundant joint and solving the remaining 6 DOF inverse kinematics. Image processing techniques are used to get data from the given image for the robotic calligraphy operation on the spandrel to restore the lost inscriptions. Path planning exercise is implemented to navigate the end-effector on the desired path to write lost inscriptions and to clean curved surfaces of muqarnas. Proposed solutions are verified by simulation using MATLAB. The results showed that the manipulator successfully tracked the given path to perform the desired operation in mihrab as well as calligraphy operation on spandrel.}, journal={2019 International Conference on Robotics and Automation in Industry (ICRAI)}, author={Bilal, Muhammad and Raza, A. and Rizwan, Mohsin and Ahsan, Muhammad and Maqbool, H.

In this paper, we formulate the calligraphy writing problem as a trajectory optimization problem, and propose an improved virtual brush model for simulating the real writing process. Our approach is inspired by pseudospectral optimal control in that we parameterize the actuator trajectory for each stroke as a Chebyshev polynomial. The proposed dynamic virtual brush model plays a key role in formulating the objective function to be optimized. Our approach shows excellent performance in drawing aesthetically pleasing characters, and does so much more efficiently than previous work, opening up the possibility to achieve real-time closed-loop control.}, booktitle={2020 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)}, publisher={IEEE Press}, author={Wang, Sen and Chen, Jiaqi and Deng, Xuanliang and Hutchinson, Seth and Dellaert, Frank}, year={2020}, month={Oct}, pages={6696–6703} }

Single strokes of the calligraphy characters are represented in a database and initialized with a scanned reference image and a manually chosen initial drawing spline. A learning procedure uses visual feedback to analyze each new iteration of the drawn stroke and updates the drawing spline such that every subsequent drawn stroke becomes more similar to the reference image. The learning procedure can be performed either in simulation, using a simple brush model to create simulated images of the strokes, or with a real robot arm equipped with a calligraphy brush and a camera that captures images of the drawn strokes. Results from both simulations and experiments with the robot arm are presented. © 2013 IEEE.}, booktitle={2013 IEEE/RSJ INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND SYSTEMS (IROS)}, publisher={IEEE}, author={Mueller, Samuel and Huebel, Nico and Waibel, Markus and D’Andrea, Raffaello}, year={2013}, month={Jan}, pages={1734–1739}, language={eng} }

A brush footprint model is proposed to represent the footprint outline, which is sensitive to the applied stress. After extracting real brush footprints from experiments, the model parameters are obtained using linear regression. Trajectories are searched along the segmented strokes of Chinese characters by varying the shape of brush footprint. The generated trajectory is 5-DOF, which is compatible to the robot art system.
