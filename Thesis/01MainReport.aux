\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {6}{\ignorespaces An example of \texttt  {transformation frames} representation. This representation shows how a reference frame is linked to the previous using two basic transformation functions, $T_n$ and $R_n$ where n is the axis along or about which the transformation is performed. The schematic is drawn in the direction of $F0$ to $F_N$ ($N$ being the last frame) but can also be interpreted in reverse direction. One can easily see which transformations are required to convert one frame of reference to the other. One only needs to take one thing in account. When going in forward direction, all the transformations are applied as they are but while going back, each successive transformation is taken as inverse. For example, frame $F5$ can be achieved from frame $F3$ by applying two successive transformations: translation along $x$ of magnitude $L1$ and rotation about $x$ of magnitude $\theta _3$. However, to go to frame $F3$ from frame $F5$, one needs to apply two successive transformations: rotation about $x$ of magnitude $-\theta _3$ and translation along \texttt  {x} of magnitude $-L1$. It should be noted that if a transformation changes the origin of the frame, the next frame has a different point shown at the center. This point is defined in the base frame. }}{21}{}}
