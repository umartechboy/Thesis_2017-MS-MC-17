    The twisting Bezier spline curves very closely mimic the ink mark of broad edge tools. An artist can not only trace existing calligraphy scripts, but also create an modify new ones with a very lean learning curve. The ease of use assures that the focus of the artist is more on the art itself than the caveats of the software solution. Once a script is ready, it can be imported in the robotic simulator to be tested on a real robot. Since the position and speed information about the end effector is all there, with a very little effort, one can create a translator that can convert this data into a flavor that the machine prefers; like G-Codes. The simulator is written in a fashion that with some effort it possible to create a communication bridge that lets it communicate with a real instance of a similar robot. This way, the simulator can be turned into a controller as well and that for a real small scale robots.
